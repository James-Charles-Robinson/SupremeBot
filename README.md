For one item with good wifi the bot can get it in aprox 4.5 seconds
## Limitations
1. Because it uses selenium the speed it buys the product heavily depends on your internet and computer speed
2. Not as fast as bots that use other methods
3. Captchas take longer because supreme are suspicios of the speed of selecting items
4. Item names must be very accurate and if there are two items that have simular names sometimes the wrong item is bought
